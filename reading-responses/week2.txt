The computer mouse is a great example of the challenges in creating an effective user interface. In the development of the mouse, a wide variety of strange ideas were proposed for a standard input method, all of which had pros and cons. For what we take for granted as the computer mouse and how it could not be any different, it is hard to imagine coming up with the system without any prior infrastructure. Do you move the mouse and then click on what you want, or do you choose an action first and then a location? These do not sound like easy problems to solve. Nevertheless, today the computer mouse seems like the only reasonable solution to the problem. Perhaps this is because it is superior to the other designs. This may be the case. Continuing from the original concept, many innovators improved on the basic idea of a moveable mouse with buttons on top. Over time, the mouse became much more standardized; people intuitively understood how to use it, software worked well with it, and it became much more user friendly and ergonomic. It was a slow development process, but over the course of many years the design improved to be what we know today. Companies like Apple that committed to the mouse played a huge role in its acceptance by the public. For instance, when Apple released the Macintosh in 1984 it was a staple of the product. They sold the mouse with the computer regardless of people’s conscious decision to adopt it. Much like many modern examples of pushing public adoption, Apple forced the mouse on its consumers and played a large role in the public’s acceptance of it. As it became increasingly recognizable through media, it eventually took place as the world’s most common way of interacting with a computer.
