Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2009 as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies.  It’s decentralization through blockchain technology allows it to be traded internationally without trading caps in a deregulated market, which allows it to be a useful intermediary in foreign exchange.  Although Bitcoin in principle could be considered the currency of the future, it suffers from quite a few pitfalls.  The exchange rate of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since its inception, starting at a fraction of a cent and peaking at almost twenty-thousand dollars.  Following its peak in value it has remained in a price range of approximately three-thousand to ten-thousand dollars, sometimes experiencing multi-thousand dollar price swings in a single day.  This fluctuation has caused traditional investors to be wary of adopting the currency as it is not technically backed by any particular government or physical good, so it has as much of a chance of dropping to zero as it does rising to a million at any time.  While more traditional investors may be wary to adopting it, Bitcoin has seen a solid adoption by technology enthusiasts and the like, mostly due to their belief that the currency or something similar will eventually replace the standard fiat currencies today, and are invested for the long term rather than for short term capital gains.  The strategy of investing used by most avid cryptocurrency traders is known as HODL, or “Hold on for dear life”, which echoes the sentiment that although the market will swing rapidly in the short term, the investment will eventually pay off if one doesn’t panic sell.  Since bitcoin’s inception, other similar cryptocurrencies have appeared that have attempted to improve upon the concepts that Bitcoin was built on.  One of these cryptocurrencies is Ethereum, which introduced the idea of “smart contracts” for automated trading.
