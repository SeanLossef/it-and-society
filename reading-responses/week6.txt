This weeks reading discusses the ever growing problem of obsolescence in technology. Obsolescence is a problem caused by changing technology without the necessary infrastructure to best handle the change. It is the cause of waste in the environment, financial burden to manufacturers, and cost to the consumer. As one technology is replaced with another, lots of resources need to be put into the manufacture of enough products to replace all the existing. Additionally, without the recycling infrastructure needed to handle the disposal of the original products, much of that original material goes to waste and pollutes the environment. This makes business practices, such as "Planned Obsolescence", questionable. We see firms increasing sales on a regular basis by causing their older products to become obsolete on purpose, forcing consumers to purchase again. This seems like it is not the decision which best benefits the environment or the consumers. Another problem related to obsolescence is overproduction. How does a manufacturer know if the demand for their good will sustain the sale of all they have produced. Also, will they have the distribution in place to sell it all. Since the 1950's this has been a major concern of manufactures. It becomes a question of sustainability and profitability for the firm. The author often discusses this concept of disposable culture. There are many companies that adopted the model of developing products cheap enough that they could simply be thrown away. This reduces the issue of obsolescence since older products no longer need to be maintained but are constantly kept fresh, updated often. This does however bode poorly from a waste perspective. Since disposal and manufacture is so inexpensive, this is a great option for the firms. However the environmental impact is often overlooked. An excellent example is the case of Gillette and the production of disposable razer blades.
