This week’s articles strike a comically polar argument about the state of coding in modern society. Programming is a very important tool in today’s world and most technologies in some way require a program to be run. Where there’s a program to run, there is a job for somebody to code and maintain that program. I believe the main argument made against the big coding movement is that although it is quite obviously very prevalent in modern society, there are many more things to be considered and dealt with in the modern workforce. Coding is just a small portion of that whole task. Without people who can understand the actual problem to be solved and manage a team of people to solve that problem, little can be done. I must agree that the big coding movement certainly does have its flaws. The movement breeds a culture of youth who have a singular mindset about programming challenges. Technology is not rigid. Learning to code in a certain language will likely be obsolete within five years. So there are plenty of reasons to not support the movement. On the contrary, I believe it is obvious that the coding movement has a variety of positive influences on the future of the workforce. Just ten years ago, there were less than half the amount of high school students who had a basically knowledge of computer science. In a computer-based world, we are now breeding a far more superior work force for the current ecosystem. Should we keep pushing toward more computer science education in the youth? The answer is probably yes. Pushing students toward interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math is important for building a strong workforce of people who can lead developments in technology. In opinion, the computer science program at my high school lead me to where I am today which I am very pleased about.
