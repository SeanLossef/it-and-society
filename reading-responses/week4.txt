Maintenance is one of the most important considerations when developing a project. This applies not to just Information Technology, but any time a product is intended to work for an extended period of time. It can be argued that the maintenance of a product is equally if not more important than the initial development of the product itself. This is evident in the article when they discuss the failure of the New York City MTA department to upkeep their subway system properly. Many recent failures have caused major disruptions in the city as they had to close many tracks to shut down for maintenance. Why is it that maintenance is such a difficult problem? First off, developers must keep in mind that maintenance is an important part of the process, and they must invest the resources to upkeep their products. But why is this so hard to do? An argument is that Americans are raised to be innovators and downplay the art of maintenance. There is a culture that the white collar are the people developing the products of the future while the blue collar simply fix what has broken. This culture can be deadly when the value of maintenance is so high. It is important to realize that the majority of technologies we use are old ones, first development many years ago. Only a small percentage of technologies in use are actually innovated. Yet, maintainers make a fraction of the salary of innovators. They are not revered as highly as innovators. Social stigma implies that they are less value to society. This is very unfortunate and is not healthy for the future of infrastructure. Perhaps the best path forwards is to scrap all infrastructure and start from scratch. It seems logical that the only way to move forward without maintenance is to always be creating everything new.
