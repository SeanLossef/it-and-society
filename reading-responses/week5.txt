In this week’s reading, Tara McPherson makes an argument regarding the development of racial and gender equality alongside advancements in technology. She starts by explaining two separate cultural advancements in the mid 1960’s leading to an argument that these independent events are linked by ignorance. At the same time of the huge social movements of the 1960’s, UNIX was being developed. It may sound surprising that these two very different events occurred simultaneously, but it is true. Literally, these systems are very different, but Tara makes a very interesting connection between the two. She makes a point about modularity, and how this concept of separate but equal was taking over culture in more than just social aspects. This concept was very important in the development of UNIX, being that UNIX is developed using Object Oriented Programming, where there are many individual parts which each perform their independent roles and are always kept separate. Tara argues that the idea of modularity is very negative and affected both UNIX and the social movement. Although it is important to always consider culture and the cultural impacts of a piece of technology, I feel that Tara is stretching to make the point she made about the connection between UNIX and the civil rights movement. I don’t believe there’s a strong connection between the two and she has a bit of a bias that is making her see the connection. I don’t believe that cultural biases can actually be integrated in an IT system. How could a program be racist? Modularity is a technical aspect of a system that is very important and valuable to many IT systems. It opens the ability for cheap sustainability and the rapid growth of technology. Almost all technological systems today are built around the concept of modularity, where individual pieces are developed separately and documented to have the ability to be combined later. This is a system where work can be more efficiently split up between developers who may not even know each other.
