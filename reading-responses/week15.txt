This weeks readings discuss the implication﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿s of "open" systems. What does it mean for something to be open, for it to be free and equally available to all people. This is an important concept with open source software such as the technologies that run a large percentage of the world around us. Technologies such as the Internet, a protocol which all devices require to connect with each other, are open source. If the Internet was not open source, it would not be possible for as many people to use it, and it would be much more expensive. This is a controversial topic because the Internet, like all technologies require somebody to design and create it, as well as people to maintain it. The Internet is updated often with necessary updates in the name of security and mobility. It seems to not fit into a capitalistic society to make a system which is so common free to all to use. How could it be financially sustainable. Well despite these concerns it appears to have worked for all this time. Many companies have been able to profit off of the foundations built of open source technologies. Additionally, note that because of the open source nature of technologies, technological evolution has grown much quicker than it would have. Open source code takes away the possibility for unfair monopolistic power by a single firm and proprietary technology. Free information means that nobody is in the dark and all can see the benefits of something. Another great example of this is operating systems related to UNIX. UNIX spawned the development of a wide variety of operating systems, including LINUX, Debian, Ubuntu, and Android, each of which have been incredibly useful to people. Note that some UNIX varients are open source and free while others have turned profit, notably Android.
